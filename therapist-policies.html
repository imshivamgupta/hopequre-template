            will be based on prevailing company rules.
            HopeQure reserves the right to recommend alternative Therapist to the Client in case
            the Client is not satisfied with the Therapist for any session related communication or
            in case the Therapist has not been maintaining quality of therapy or has been in
            violation of any clause of this agreement.

            Payment and Refund Clause:
          </h3>

          <p>
            After you have delivered your services to the clients through your use of the service,
            HopeQure will facilitate the payment of the applicable amount to be paid by the client
            to you as your limited payment collection agent. Payment of the amount payable by
            the client in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by
            the client to you. Such payment shall be inclusive of applicable taxes where required
            by law. Amounts paid by the client to you are final and non-refundable, unless
            otherwise determined by HopeQure. <br> <br>
            You retain the right to receive a lower amount as final payment towards the delivery
            of services by you to a client. HopeQure will respond accordingly to any request from
            you to modify the amount to be paid by a client for a particular service delivered by
            you to the said client.
          </p>

          <p>
            You agree and acknowledge that the amount to be paid by a client for the services
            offered by you may vary based on geographical areas, time periods, demand, weather
            and local or national holidays, particular days of the week and other factors that might
            be determined by HopeQure from time to time. <br><br>
            This payment structure and determination of the amounts to be paid by the client to
            you is intended to fully compensate you for the services provided by you to the client.
            HopeQure may change the fee structure from time to time or may change the structure
            of fees or refund / chargeback / penalty from time to time or may add new fees
            structure in addition to the prevailing one, to suit the needs of all stakeholders. The
            Therapist authorises HopeQure to make such modification in the fee structure as per
            the requirements and pay you the fee due to yourself, on bi monthly or monthly basis.
            All taxes, statutory and regulatory compliance, which are applicable to you as per the
            law are the sole responsibility of the Therapist.
          </p>

          <p>
            HopeQure will, on your behalf Generate an invoice for the services provided by you
            to the client. The invoice will be raised in your name and sent to the client via the
            HopeQure platform and/or any other mode of communication as decided by
            HopeQure. <br><br>
            If the Therapist does not join the session, while the client is on call, the Therapist will
            be charged five times penalty of His/Her fee to ensure clients do not face such
            circumstances again.<br><br>
            If the Client is not satisfied with the quality of conversation during the session and
            rates the Therapist poor or very poor, the Therapist will not be paid the fee amount
            and the money will be refunded to the Client towards unsatisfactory services from the
            Therapist. HopeQure, however, will ensure a complain of Client about session quality
            is adequately answered to ensure Client is not taking undue privilege of this point.
            The due fee to the Therapist will be paid digitally through available and approved
            digital payment methods for which the Therapist will keep updating their bank
            account details. The invoice generated for such transactions will be sent electronically
            to the respective mail id as mentioned in the therapist’s profile or any other mode
            which HopeQure deems fit.<br><br>
            In the event of any difference, disparity, deviation, divergence or disagreement the
            Therapist should raise a complaint within 7 days of raising the invoice for correction
            and resolution. Any complaint not raised for more than 30 days of raising the invoice
            will not be addressed.
          </p>

          <p>
            As far as refund of any amount is concerned, HopeQure is at liberty to decide on the
            basis of the circumstances and the facts of every case to determine whether any such
            amount is liable to be returned/refunded or not.
