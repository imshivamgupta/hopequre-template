                            automated system that lists the Practitioners, their profile and information regarding their
                            Practice
                            on its Website. These listings of Practitioners do not represent any fixed objective ranking
                            or
                            endorsement by HopeQure. HopeQure will not be liable for any change in the relevance of the
                            Practitioners on search results, which may take place from time to time. The listing of
                            Practitioners
                            will be based on automated computation of the various factors including inputs made by the
                            Users
                            including their comments and feedback. Such factors may change from time to time, in order
                            to
                            improve the listing algorithm. HopeQure in no event will be held responsible for the
                            accuracy and
                            the relevancy of the listing order of the Practitioners on the Website.

                            through the Website; b) Value added telephonic services which connect Users directly to the

                            Practitioner in advance about the same. When Practitioner informs HopeQure of the incident
                            or

                            <b>3.6.1 Definition:</b> HopeQure’s Consult is a feature owned and provided by HopeQure that
                            allows
                            Users &amp; Practitioners to communicate, either on unpaid mode or on paid mode, depending
                            on the
                            option chosen by the User. Further, Users may access this feature on HopeQure’s platform to
                            get
                            assigned, for the purposes of consultation, to a Practitioner whereby such Practitioners
                            are, by
                            default, assigned through the system’s algorithm/software-program that finds the most
                            available and
                            accepting Practitioner or Users may choose Practitioners of choice through the search
                            options made
                            available on HopeQure’s Website. The scope of this feature as detailed herein is
                            collectively
                            referred to as &quot;Consult&quot;. <br><br>

                            3.6.2 Terms for Users: The Users expressly understand, acknowledge and agree to the
                            following set
                            forth herein below: <br>
                            In the event the Users intend to consult a specific Practitioner of choice, the same is
                            facilitated
                            through search options as made available on HopeQure’s Website. In cases where Users cannot
                            choose a Practitioner (due to system setup), the system uses an algorithm/software-program
                            to find
                            the most available and accepting Practitioner. <br>
                            In case any prescription is being provided to User by the Practitioner, the same is being
                            provided on
                            the basis of online consultation, however it may vary when examined in person, hence in no
                            event
                            shall the prescription provided by Practitioners be relied on as a final and conclusive
                            solution.

                            The Users agree to use the advice from Practitioner on the website pursuant to: <br>
                            a) an ongoing treatment with their medical practitioner; <br>
                            b) a condition which does not require emergency treatment, physical examination or medical
                            attention; <br>
                            c) medical history available as records with them for reference; <br>
                            d) a record of physical examination and report thereof with them, generated through their
                            local
                            medical practitioner; <br>
                            e) consultation with their medical practitioner before abandoning or modifying their ongoing
                            treatment. <br><br>

                            The User agrees that by using Consult, the Practitioners on Consult will not be conducting
                            physical
                            examination of the Users, hence they may not have or be able to derive important information
                            that
                            is usually obtained through a physical examination. User acknowledges and agrees that the
                            User is
                            aware of this limitation and agrees to assume the complete risk of this limitation. <br><br>

                            The Practitioner shall promptly reply to the User after receiving User’s communication. In

                            The Practitioner has the discretion to cancel any consultation at any point in time in cases
                            where the
                            Practitioner feels, it is beyond his/her expertise or his/her capacity to treat the User. In
                            such cases, it
                            may trigger a refund to the User and the User has the option of choosing other
                            Practitioners.
                            However, it is strongly recommended that the Practitioner advise the User and explain
                            appropriately
                            for next steps. <br><br>

                            health and wellness related content. <br><br>
                            4.7.2 A Practitioner can use health feed by logging in from their profile, creating original
                            content
                            comprising text, audio, video, images data or any combination of the same (“as defined in
                            Clause
                            3.7.2”), and uploading said Content to HopeQure’s servers. The Practitioner can upload their
